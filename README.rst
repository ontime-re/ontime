Getting Started
---------------

For now, the best is to look at the examples in the ``notebooks`` folder.

Purpose of the library
----------------------

The purpose of onTime is to make a technological transfer to the partners of the 
DiagnoBat project with respect to their intellectual property. Most parts of 
the library are extendable by using dynamically loaded classes. This
mecanism allows anyone to keep parts of the library private within their own company. 

The library objectives are :


#. to extend the time series libraries (Darts, GluonTS, Kats, etc.)
#. to provide benchmarking tools for models and/or detectors
#. to provide domain specific tools (e.g. for energy consumption, district heating networks, etc.)

In case you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask them by opening an issue or email.
